- ✅ Deployed the first working iteration of the dashboard to Streamlit Community Cloud using the GitHub repo
- ✅ Successfully tested the app online with sample data
- ✅ Updated the deployment to use larger/full datasets for further testing and feedback
- ✅ Fixed missing dependencies (e.g., plotly) in `requirements.txt` for cloud deployment
