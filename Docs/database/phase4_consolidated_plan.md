# Phase 4 - Streamlit Dashboard Consolidated Plan

## üéØ Project Overview

**Goal**: Create a Python-based Streamlit dashboard for TBONTB cricket team statistics (2013-2025)  
**Purpose**: Team engagement, easy data visualization, and portfolio showcase  
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks for MVP deployment

---

## üìã Platform Decision

### Streamlit - Selected ‚úÖ

| Aspect | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Learning Curve** | Python-based, easy to learn | Less interactive than dedicated BI tools |
| **Cost** | Free hosting on Streamlit Cloud | Some layout limitations |
| **Portfolio Value** | Great for showcasing technical skills | - |
| **Team Access** | Good mobile support, web-based | - |
| **Future Growth** | Can upgrade to Plotly/Dash later | - |

**Rejected Alternatives**: Power BI (cost/learning curve), Tableau (expensive/overkill), Dash (too complex for first project)

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository & Environment Setup

### Repository Structure
**Decision**: Create separate repository for clean deployment
- New repo: `tbontb-dashboard` 
- Keeps dashboard code separate from data processing
- Easier for Streamlit Cloud deployment
- Better portfolio showcase

```
/tbontb-dashboard (new repository)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /data
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Explains data sources
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore         # Ignores actual CSV files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /pages                 # Multi-page components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                 # Main dashboard file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Project documentation
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/tbontb-dashboard

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 3. Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install packages
pip install streamlit pandas plotly

# 5. Save dependencies
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# 6. Run dashboard
streamlit run app.py
```

## üìä Data Architecture

### Data Source Strategy
**Approach**: Separate CSVs with helper functions for joins

**Available Data Files**:
- `TBONTB_all_batting.csv` - Individual batting performances
- `TBONTB_all_bowling.csv` - Individual bowling performances  
- `TBONTB_match_info.csv` - Match details and outcomes
- `TBONTB_venues.csv` - Venue-specific statistics

**Data Loading Pattern**:
```python
@st.cache_data
def load_and_process_data():
    # Load separate files
    batting_df = pd.read_csv("data/TBONTB_all_batting.csv")
    bowling_df = pd.read_csv("data/TBONTB_all_bowling.csv")
    matches_df = pd.read_csv("data/TBONTB_match_info.csv")
    
    # Create derived views as needed
    player_combined = pd.merge(
        batting_df.groupby(['player_name', 'Season'])['runs'].sum().reset_index(),
        bowling_df.groupby(['player_name', 'Season'])['wickets'].sum().reset_index(),
        on=['player_name', 'Season'], how='outer'
    ).fillna(0)
    
    return {
        "batting": batting_df,
        "bowling": bowling_df,
        "matches": matches_df,
        "player_combined": player_combined
    }
```

**Benefits**:
- Clean data organization
- Efficient caching (joins happen once per session)
- Flexible for future requirements
- Maintains data integrity

## üé® User Interface Design

### Sidebar Configuration
```python
# Global filters (apply across all pages)
st.sidebar.title("Filters")

# Minimum games filter
min_games = st.sidebar.slider("Minimum Games Played", 1, 50, 3)

# Season selection
all_seasons = data["batting"]["Season"].unique().tolist()
selected_seasons = st.sidebar.multiselect("Select Seasons", all_seasons, default=all_seasons)

# Main navigation
st.sidebar.title("Navigation")
page = st.sidebar.radio("Select Page", [
    "Team Overview", 
    "Player Statistics", 
    "Venue Analysis", 
    "Submit Feedback"
])
```

### Page Structure

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Starter Application Template
```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
from datetime import datetime

# Page configuration
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="TBONTB Cricket Dashboard", 
    page_icon="üèè", 
    layout="wide"
)

# Data loading function
@st.cache_data
def load_data():
    # Implementation from data architecture section
    pass

# Main application logic
def main():
    # Load data
    data = load_data()
    
    # Header
    st.title("üèè TBONTB Cricket Dashboard")
    st.markdown("*Team statistics from 2013-2025 seasons*")
    
    # Sidebar filters and navigation
    # Implementation from UI design section
    
    # Page routing
    if page == "Team Overview":
        show_team_overview(data)
    elif page == "Player Statistics":
        show_player_stats(data)
    elif page == "Venue Analysis":
        show_venue_analysis(data)
    elif page == "Submit Feedback":
        show_feedback_form()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Features Implementation

**Player Statistics Page**:
```python
def show_player_stats(data):
    st.header("Player Statistics")
    
    # Player selection with filtering
    filtered_players = get_filtered_players(data, min_games, selected_seasons)
    selected_player = st.selectbox("Select Player", filtered_players)
    
    # Display statistics
    player_data = data["batting"][data["batting"]["player_name"] == selected_player]
    
    col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
    with col1:
        st.metric("Total Runs", player_data["runs"].sum())
    with col2:
        st.metric("Innings", len(player_data))
    with col3:
        st.metric("Average", round(player_data["runs"].mean(), 2))
    
    # Visualization
    fig = px.bar(player_data, x="Season", y="runs", 
                title=f"{selected_player}'s Runs by Season")
    st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
```

**Feedback Collection System**:
```python
def show_feedback_form():
    st.header("Team Feedback")
    
    with st.form("feedback_form"):
        name = st.text_input("Your Name")
        feedback_type = st.selectbox("Type", 
            ["Bug Report", "Feature Request", "General Feedback"])
        message = st.text_area("Your Message")
        
        submitted = st.form_submit_button("Submit Feedback")
        
        if submitted:
            # Save to CSV or integrate with email service
            save_feedback(name, feedback_type, message)
            st.success("Thank you for your feedback!")
```
