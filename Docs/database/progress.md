    Dim innerDict As Object
    
    ' Find Team/Opposition Extras rows by match
    For i = 2 To lastRow
        Dim matchID As String, playerName As String
        matchID = ws.Cells(i, 1).Value
        playerName = ws.Cells(i, 5).Value
        
        If playerName = "Team Extras" Or playerName = "Opposition Extras" Then

                Set innerDict = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")
                matchDict.Add matchID, innerDict
            Else
                Set innerDict = matchDict(matchID)
            End If
            innerDict(playerName) = i
        End If
    Next i
    
    ' Swap runs_conceded values
    For Each mID In matchDict.Keys
        Set innerDict = matchDict(mID)
        If innerDict.exists("Team Extras") And innerDict.exists("Opposition Extras") Then
            Dim teamRow As Long, oppRow As Long
            teamRow = innerDict("Team Extras")
            oppRow = innerDict("Opposition Extras")
            
            Dim teamRuns As Variant, oppRuns As Variant
            teamRuns = ws.Cells(teamRow, 7).Value
            oppRuns = ws.Cells(oppRow, 7).Value
            
            ws.Cells(teamRow, 7).Value = oppRuns
            ws.Cells(oppRow, 7).Value = teamRuns
        End If
    Next mID
End Sub
```

### ‚úÖ September 2025: Venue-Based Reporting & Data Workflow Enhancement

- **Venue reporting process launched:** Created a dedicated `TBONTB_venues.xlsx` workbook, separate from the master stats file, to support venue-focused reports and future deep dives.
- **Pivot table-driven stats extraction:** Used pivot tables to separate, clean, and organize venue stats for easy access and reporting.
- **Reusable analysis:** The new workbook structure allows for quick updates and targeted venue analysis without impacting the main master stats file.

### ‚úÖ August 2025: Season-by-Season Reporting, QA, and Data Insights
- **Comprehensive season-by-season tables completed:** Populated all summary and milestone tables in `report_2.md` for 2013‚Äì2025 using a mix of manual entry, AI tools, and Excel dashboards.
