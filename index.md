# Two Bats or Not To Bat – Project Docs

This is the documentation hub for the Two Bats or Not To Bat project, a personal cricket data initiative built around a custom database, a blog of seasonal analysis, and a dashboard for match stats and team insights.

The goal here is to document and outline how the project works, how it’s evolving, and how it ties together across tools and platforms. It’s part devlog, part portfolio, and part behind-the-scenes notebook. Aimed at anyone curious about the process, and especially those interested in data, cricket, or collaboration.

Updates will appear as the project grows, with links to the blog, dashboard, and source repos. This space is meant to be readable, linkable, and friendly.
